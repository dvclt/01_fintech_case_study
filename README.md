# NANO

## Overview and Origin

- NANO DIGITAL HOME LOAN is provided by
  Digital Mortgage Solutions Pty Ltd. The company was registered on 5 September 2018.

- Founded by ex-Westpac executives Andrew Walker and Chris Lumby, NANO was established with the belief it could leverage technology to solve pain points in the approval process that has blown out to more than a month with some lenders.

- The founders believed an over-reliance on legacy systems, and a lack of appetite for innovation regarding improved customer experience at big four institutions meant there would be a big demand for a smarter option.

- The company secured $33 million first funding round from New Zealand-based Bolton Equities.

## Business Activities:

- The company seeks to address the traditional mortgage underwriting problem where low-risk customers are paying interest that doesn’t reflect their risk profile. Due to the structural problem with the current model too many low-risk mortgage holders are effectively subsidising higher-risk customers when accessing the same lending products.

- The company address this problem by offering lower-rate financing to borrowers with a better risk profile, and do away with volumes of paper forms with a speedy digital application process.

- Australia’s digital home loans market is rapidly growing and it is expected to surpass $100 billion in the next five years.

- The intended customers are:

  - Australian citizens or permanent residents with minimum $100k household income and good credit rating.
  - The company offers loan to purchase, refinance, and invest Australian residential properties with up to 80% Loan to Value Ration.
  - The loan amount is from $100K up to $2.5M, with a cap of $5M across all loans by a customer.

- The traditional home loan approval is a lengthy process. The lender requires a lot of documents and submissions from the potential borrowers to consider their credit history and current financial situation to decide if they are likely to make loan repayments.

- NANO can approval a loan in less than 10 minutes, enhancing the customer experience.

- NANO uses data and AI to identify low-risk borrowers to offer more competitive rates than tradition banks. The use of data and AI also helps speed up the loan approval process, which included the property valuation, extracting customer loan repayment history, an income and expense check using a process that “scrapes” bank account data when the applicant shares their banking details, loan serviceability calculations and identification to meet know-your-customer rules.

- NANO obtains data from CoreLogic to determine the suitability of the security property. High quality property data and the application of machine learning make it possible to quickly assess a property with a high degree of confidence.

## Landscape:

- NANO operates in the Australian home loan market. The total value of owner-occupier home loans written in Australia in April 2022 was $17.39 billion, with the average Australian home loan size being $611,158.

- There has not been any major trends and innovations of the home loan sector over the last 5-10 years.

- The other major digital mortgage companies are:
  - [UBank (NAB)](https://www.ubank.com.au/)
  - [OneTwo (ANZ)](https://www.onetwo.com.au/index.html)
  - [Yard](https://www.yard.com.au/)
  - [Athena](https://www.athena.com.au/)

## Results

- Companies, like NANO, in the digital mortgage space has pushed the service standard of quick approval times. The new service standard will create a new baseline for customer expectations in the $2 trillion mortgage Australian market. A recent example would be Commonwealth Bank’s Unloan product, which allows customers to apply for credit in 10 minutes.

- The core metrics for companies in the home lending sector are:

  - Pull Through Rate
  - Decision to Close Time Cycle
  - Abandoned Loan Rate
  - Average Origination Value
  - Application Approval Rate
  - Net Charge-Off Rate
  - Customer Acquisition Cost
  - Average Number of Conditions Per Loan

- NANO can already approve a loan in 10 minutes. In a recent presentation to reporters, it showed a simple, dummy loan being fully approved in 5 minutes and 20 seconds.

- Since launching in June 2021 for refinancing, NANO has made $550 million in loans, to 1100 borrowers, funded by warehouse facilities provided by one of the major banks and another lender. NANO aspires to grow this to more than $1 billion by the end of the year, after extending the product to new loans, minuscule compared to the overall market.

- In terms of loan book, the NANO is on par with its competitor:
  - OneTwo is expected to hit $100m in lending.
  - Athena has distributed just over $3.3 billion of home loans in Oct 2021.

## Recommendations

- NANO should add categorisation features for its offset account, which will label the transactions into the common income and expenses categories. This will allow the customers to review their spending habits, adjust their spending according to their circumstances. This feature has become a common features from many bank app.

- In addition, NANO should expand this feature to allow customers to sync all of their accounts from different financial institution to have a complete picture of their personal finance and make confident financial decisions.

- This will enhance the customer experience and retention when using the services of NANO. Moreover, with the collection of transaction from customer's other bank accounts, NANO can accurate assess the credit risk of the customer to offer better product (lower rate), review their current serviceability (reduce bad loan)

- This would require:

  - utilising Open Banking platform to access transactions from customer's other bank accounts;
  - AI/ML to provide real time monitor and assess the risk profile of the customers
